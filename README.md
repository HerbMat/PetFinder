## Spring Framework
The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration
model for modern Java-based enterprise applications -- on any kind of deployment
platform. A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application
level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams
can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to
specific deployment environments.

The framework also serves as the foundation for [Spring Integration][], [Spring Batch][]
and the rest of the Spring [family of projects][]. Browse the repositories under
the [Spring organization][] on GitHub for a full list.
